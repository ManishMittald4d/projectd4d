    value: `Nothing goes to waste in a forest.  Nothing at all!  Everything gets cleaned up.  Absolutely everything!
        When leopards don’t finish their food, Who eats the rest?   The vultures and the hyenas!
        And the hungry wild boar.   GRUNT! GRUNT!
        When the vultures and the hyenas waste their food, Who gobbles it up?   The flies and the maggots!
        And the hungry wild boar.   GRUNT! GRUNT!
        When elephants poop in the forest, Who snacks on that?   The dung beetles!
        And the hungry wild boar.   GRUNT! GRUNT!
        When branches, leaves, and rain fall on the ground, Who feasts on it all?   The termites and the fungi!
        And the hungry wild boar.   GRUNT! GRUNT!
        When the air gets dirty with smoke, Who sucks it all in?   The trees!
        Ummm, but not the hungry wild boar.   GRUNT! GRUNT!`,

    label: "Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee finds Adventure",
    value: `Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee lived in the ocean. All day long she clung to the same slippery rock with her single big foot. Her tiny tentacles caught tasty treats. On days when she felt cross, her stinging tentacles kept the other creatures away. But today her rock felt lonely.
        “I have no fins. I am different to every other creature.”   I have no feet. “Even that hermit crab is off having adventures!” “Save me! That fish wants to pluck me out of my shell!” Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee whipped up her stinging tentacles and hid the hermit underneath them.   “Go away, you big bully!” The big fish bared his teeth, but was afraid of being stung. He gave up and swam away with a cheeky flick of his tail. “That was close!” said the crab. “Is it safe now?”   “You can come out, Crab. What’s your name?” “Herman. I’m a hermit, but I think I need a bodyguard. I wish I was as brave as you!” “I’m Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee. I wish I had amazing adventures like you.” “But why don’t you?” He asked. “I’m stuck to my rock. And I don’t have legs!” She replied. “Well, I don’t have stings, but I do have an idea!” Herman took Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee by the tentacle and danced around her, pulling silly faces. First Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee snorted, and then she giggled — and then she laughed so hard she popped right off her rock. Herman gently picked her up and settled her on his shell. “Are you ready? I feel an adventure coming on.” He said. Ann-Nem-Oh-Nee adventures all over the ocean, catching tasty treats. Now she only uses her stinging tentacles to keep the nasty fish away from Herman. And she never, ever feels lonely.`,

      Penguins don’t fly, they swim.   But we’re too young to swim.   So we walk.

      I climb on to the chair, and then on the table!

      “Papa! Papa!” I shout.  Papa laughs. “Sonu, learn to climb down!” he says.
      I am afraid. But I do not cry.
      Slowly, I get down from the table, and down from the chair.
      At last, I have learnt to climb down too!`,
